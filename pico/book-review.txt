Machine Learning requires quite a bit of knowlege in several computer areas.  

These areas include cameras,  microphones, 3D Gyroscope, 3D Accelerometer, other sensors and micro processor. 
Software also plays a major role in making one successful in the area of study.  The book provides
a very good introductary overview of the current status of Machine Learning. 
In a 2nd edition, prehaps a description of how the ML models are generation would 
be helpful. Like the one in "https://github.com/develone/my-projects-docs/blob/master/tflite/video-series1.pdf".
Also a description of how the python is executed in an Nano-RP2040-Connect as a file 
model.cc which is just a bunch of hex numbers.
