Machine Learning requires quite a bit of knowlege in several computer areas.  

These areas include cameras,  microphones, 3D Gyroscope, 3D Accelerometer, other sensors and micro processor. 
Software also plays a major role in making one successful in the area of study.  The book provides
a very good introductary overview of the current status of Machine Learning. The book also
tries to explain the need for ML in several areas privacy, and latency in the networking
as the size and number of images continues to out pace the growth in networking. 
In a 2nd edition, prehaps a description of how the ML models are generation would 
be helpful. Like the one in "https://github.com/develone/my-projects-docs/blob/master/tflite/video-series1.pdf".
Also a description of how the python is executed in an Nano-RP2040-Connect as a file 
model.cc which is just a bunch of hex numbers.
