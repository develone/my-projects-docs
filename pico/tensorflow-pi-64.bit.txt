In order to build Tensorflow requires bazel.

Essential Bazel â€” ... Build and test software of any size, quickly and reliably. Industry leaders like Google, 
Stripe, and Dropbox trust Bazel to build heavy-duty ..

Theses links provide how an application could run on low end systems like RPi zero .

I have a question, why tensorflow would take 41 hrs creating a pip package and 9 hrs. creating  a C++.

Next I will be testing the C++ approach.

This shows why I believe PICO using TensorFlow Lite is best with Ultibo.

Currenlty testing the pip package approach.

Ultibo provides:
Camera 
Networking
disk storage
Interfaces to Pico 
	UART.

Pico provides:
Tensorflow lite
FreeRtos
WIFI
The WIFI could provide additional network since it provides https://github.com/develone/pico-exampl ... cess_point
