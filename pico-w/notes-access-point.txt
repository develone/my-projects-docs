What is an Access Point?
An access point is a device that creates a wireless local area network, or WLAN, 
usually in an office or large building. An access point connects to a wired router, switch, or 
hub via an Ethernet cable, and projects a Wi-Fi signal to a designated area. For example, 
if you want to enable Wi-Fi access in your company's reception area but donâ€™t have a router 
within range, you can install an access point near the front desk and run an Ethernet 
cable through the ceiling back to the server room.
