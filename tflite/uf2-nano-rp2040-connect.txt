 To make the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect able to connect with the OpenMV 
 IDE and allow us to write scripts in MicroPython we first need to 
 update its firmware. This tutorial will show you how to make the 
 Nano RP2040 Connect work with OpenMV. We will first go through how 
 to update the board's firmware, to make it compatible with OpenMV. 
 Then we wi
 ll run a simple script on the board using OpenMV.
 
 Activating the Bootloader Mode

First we need to forcefully trigger the bootloader so that OpenMV can 
install the required firmware on our board. You can do that by double 
tapping the reset button on the board. A mass store device named

RPI-RP2

should mount automatically. If this doesn't work, follow the steps below 
to force the board into bootloader mode

Forcing the Bootloader

Begin by disconnecting the board from your computer by removing the USB cable. 
Now place a jumper wire between the REC and GND pins on the board, 
then connect the board to your computer.
